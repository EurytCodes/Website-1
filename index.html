          <strong>Nature</strong>, in a broadest sense, is the natural, physical and material world or universe.
          Nature can also refer to life in general.
          The physical world and everything in it(such as plants,animals,mountains,oceans,stars etc.)
          that is not made by people. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often
          understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

          However, within the various uses of the word today, "Nature" often refers to geneology and wildlife.
          Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, in some cases to the processes
          associated with inanimate objects-the way that particular type of things exist and change of their own
          accord, such as weather and geology of the Earth. Nature is beautiful because it's alive, moving, reproductive.
          In nature we observe growth and development in living things.

          But Whats so special about nature is, there is no question that Earth has been a giving planet. Everything
          living creatures have needed to survive, and thrive, was provided by the natural world around us: food, water,
          medicine, materials for shelter, and even natural cycles such as climate and nutrients.
          <br>
          It's very important that we value nature. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soil provide us with the food
          we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for other numerous
          goods and services. Nature is our sole supplier.

          Nature has been proven, time and time again, to reduce depression, anxiety, stress, and anger, as well as 
          generally boost psychological wellbeing. Nature can help to make you feel happier and more content as a 
          person, which can improve many areas of your life.
          <br>
          Though some human activities cause damage to the nature on a global scale, we can also help save nature
          not to the fullest but a liitle. A healthy environment provides nutrients that flow up the food chain,
          from plants to animals, to provide energy. By preserving nature, the planet and all its inhabitants are guaranteed
           a constant supply of clean water and fresh air.
